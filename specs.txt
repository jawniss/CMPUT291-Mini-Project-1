Login Screen:
	- ask user if they are registered or would like to
	IF REGISTERED:
	- take user input for user/pass
	- query database to see if 
		- if match, goto next
		- if doesn't match, stay same screen and tell them
	IF NOT REGISTERED:
	- ask for input: email, name, pwd, city, gender
	- add row to users table
	- congratulate them on logging in, send them to login screen

	From here, I think we should ask the user what kind of functionality
	they would like to use.

FUNCTIONALITIES:

List products:
	- automatically query database and list all products that are in active sales (meaning that current date < edate)
	- query should return pid, desc, count(pid) in previews, avg(p.rating), count(pid) in active sales
		- SORT BY (count(pid) in active sales) DESC
	- after above query, ask if they would like to make a selection (ask for pid)
		- given above pid, ask if they want to: write p review, view p reviews, view all active sales related to item sort by (edate - current date) ascending
			WRITE P REVIEW:
				- ask for input(rating(float 1-5), rtext(limit to 140 char)), generate rid and use given pid and use current datetime for rdate and user email is reviewer, then add value to previews table
				- return to list products
			VIEW P REVIEW:
				-
			VIEW ALL ACTIVE SALES WITH PRODUCT IN IT:
				-
